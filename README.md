Hi!

My name is Andrea (user: WinterWind33). I'm currently a physics BSc student and i love doing physics and go beyond nature mysteries but i'm also a computer enthusiast and i'm learning 
programming things all by myself (outside those asserted in the physics course).

I love mixing physics and programming because i think that these two are deeply connected by the logic behind solving problems of any kind. 
- Physics teaches a lot of mathematics but also a lot of problem solving and uses computer science to solve and predict results. 
- On the other hand, computer science uses a lot of mathematics and logic to solve world problems and physics makes the understanding of these problems a lot 
more simple and straightforward, especially in graphics and simulations.

I'm currently learning design patterns in C++ to work on my personal projects. I'm also learning computational physics and Python because i'm also interested in machine learning
and deep learning.

My projects may be a little too rusty and the code can be a little too messy but many of my projects are only for educational and pathfinder purpose so nothing that is intended
to be deployed in the real world will be found in my repositories (for now).
