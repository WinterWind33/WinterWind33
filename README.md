Hi!

My name is Andrea (user: WinterWind33). I'm a physics BSc student and software developer.

I'm currently working as a full time C++ developer at [Zuru Tech](https://zuru.tech/) where my computer science knowledge is boosting and my skills are greatly improving and i can express myself with a great team! Here, i had the opportunity to learn a lot of theory and practice of software testing, especially the theory of the xUnit framework family and in my projects i try to apply it very widely. 

I've started my journey as a developer when i was 14 (more than 10 years ago) and accross the years i've incremented my passion for computer science and physics whose passion had begun during my university career.

I love mixing physics and programming because i think that these two are deeply connected by the logic behind solving problems of any kind. 
- Physics teaches a lot of mathematics but also a lot of problem solving and uses computer science to solve and predict results. 
- On the other hand, computer science uses a lot of mathematics and logic to solve world problems and physics makes the understanding of these problems a lot 
more simple and straightforward, especially in graphics and simulations (which i love).

In my free time i love to read a good book, do some physical activity (jogging, swimming and trekking mainly) but i also love to express my ideas inside different programming projects as i love to combine applied science with programming, as i said.

I think of myself as a nice and open guy, i love to deepen my knowledge with people and i love talking :D.
